    Specification --> AwaitingWaveApproval --> Implementation
```

4. Run it:
No runnable implementation yet. This is a planned Wave 2 project.

5. Decisions and limits: Public repository reserved for independent work using public or synthetic data. Implementation has not started. No company affiliation or usage is claimed. Acceptance check: Match rate and false-match rate on synthetic data with injected noise.

6. Next: Implement after approval for Wave 2, then run and publish the required acceptance commands.
